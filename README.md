<h2 align="center">🌌 Reimagining Cloud Storage</h2>
<p align="center">
  CassielDrive isn't just another file manager. It's a visually stunning, highly optimized alternative client for <b>Google Drive</b>. Designed with a pure OLED dark UI, glassmorphism layers, and silky 60-120 FPS transitions, it completely redesigns how you interact with your personal cloud. Watch your files orbit in our signature <b>Storage Galaxy</b> and manage multiple Google Accounts with zero limits.
</p>

## 🌟 Core Features & Architectural Highlights

### 🚀 Unlimited Cloud Expansion & Account Aggregation
Most cloud providers trap you in paid tiers once you hit 15GB. CassielDrive solves this by acting as a master unified storage client. It allows you to authenticate and link **an infinite number of Google Drive accounts simultaneously**. The internal architecture abstracts these isolated accounts into a single cohesive UI, allowing you to instantly hop between "Drives" and treat multiple free 15GB limits as one massive, boundless cloud repository.

### 🔒 Military-Grade AES-256 Secure Vault Architecture
Cloud privacy is a major concern, which is why CassielDrive introduces the **Cassiel Vault**. Rather than relying on standard cloud-side encryption, the app implements true **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**. When you upload a file into the Vault, CassielDrive uses **AES-256 local encryption** running directly on your device's CPU. The file is mathematically scrambled using your private passphrase *before* a single byte is transmitted to Google's servers. Even if your Google account is fully compromised, your files remain completely unreadable without your local Vault key.

### 💻 Widescreen Desktop Optimization & Adaptive UI Constraints
A common flaw in Flutter web apps is that mobile interfaces awkwardly stretch to fill ultra-wide 4K desktop monitors. CassielDrive solves this natively using intelligent layout architectures. The entire application widget tree wraps its core views in a strict `ConstrainedBox(maxWidth: 800)`. This guarantees that whether you are on a massive 32-inch monitor or a 6-inch Android phone, the UI remains perfectly proportioned, centralized, and visually stunning, providing a premium desktop-class experience.

### 🧭 Minimalist Floating Navigation Pill
To maximize the visual real estate for your file grids and folder layouts, we eliminated the bulky, screen-consuming bottom navigation bars typical to Android applications. CassielDrive features a streamlined, non-obtrusive **Top-Right Floating Navigation Pill**. This compact router floats intelligently above your content, giving you instant access to Dashboard, Files, Vault, Accounts, and Settings without eating into your vertical screen space.

### 🌌 OLED-Optimized Dynamic Themes & 3D CSS Rendering
CassielDrive is engineered around a deep-dark, high-contrast palette specifically tailored for OLED displays. This includes frosted glassmorphism containers, neon accents, and fluid 120Hz gesture animations. Furthermore, our standalone promotional website pushes the limits of modern web design with a **pure HTML/CSS 3D device mockup**. By leveraging advanced CSS `transform-style: preserve-3d` properties and keyframe animations, the site realistically renders a floating, rotating 3D phone model—delivering a wildly immersive visual hook without slowing down the page with heavy image assets.



## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup & Authentication

CassielDrive runs strictly on **your own private Google Cloud project credentials**, meaning Google will never throttle your API requests and your data remains entirely in your control.

### <span style="color:#25a7da">1. Generate Your Private OAuth Client ID</span>
1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the **Google Drive API** within the Library.
3. Configure the **OAuth Consent Screen** (Crucial: Add your personal email to the **Test users** list).
4. Create **OAuth Client ID Credentials**. When prompted for an application type, you must select **Desktop app** *(This allows Android to utilize secure local loopback ports for authentication).*

### <span style="color:#25a7da">2. Connect Your Accounts</span>
1. Launch CassielDrive on [Web](https://cassiel-drive-v2.vercel.app/) or natively on your Android phone.
2. Click the gear icon to open **Settings**.
3. Input your newly generated Client ID and Client Secret.
4. Navigate to the **Accounts** tab ("Accts") and tap Add Account.
5. Authenticate via Google, and enjoy your unlimited, hyper-fast cloud!

## 💻 Build from Source (Developers)

CassielDrive is fully open-source and ready to compile for any environment. Ensure you have the latest version of [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cassielxyz/CassielDrive.git
cd CassielDrive

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the Development Web Server
flutter run -d web

# Compile the Android Production APK
flutter build apk --release
```

### 🐧 Linux desktop

The `linux/` platform folder is generated on demand, and a couple of upstream
plugins need small workarounds on modern toolchains, so use the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/setup_linux.sh        # flutter create + build workarounds + release build
./scripts/run_linux.sh          # launches the bundle (add --x11 or --software if needed)
```

What the script takes care of for you:

| Symptom | Cause | Handled by |
|---|---|---|
| `Method not found: 'CupertinoPageTransitionsBuilder'` | the builder moved from the Material to the Cupertino library | fixed in source (`app_theme.dart` imports `cupertino.dart`) |
| `json.hpp … error: identifier '_json' preceded by whitespace … [-Werror,-Wdeprecated-literal-operator]` | `flutter_secure_storage_linux` vendors an old nlohmann/json; clang ≥ 19 rejects it | `setup_linux.sh` appends `-Wno-error` / `-Wno-deprecated-literal-operator` to `linux/CMakeLists.txt` and `CXXFLAGS` |
| `PlatformException(Libsecret error, Failed to unlock the keyring)` then crash on launch | no unlocked gnome-keyring / Secret Service | the app no longer crashes — `SafeStorage` falls back to local storage; `run_linux.sh` also tries to start `gnome-keyring-daemon` |
| Segfault right after the window opens | Impeller/GL driver or Wayland issue | `./scripts/run_linux.sh --x11` or `--software` |

Optional but recommended for encrypted token storage:

```bash
# Arch / EndeavourOS
sudo pacman -S gnome-keyring libsecret
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install gnome-keyring libsecret-1-0
```

## 🚀 Vercel Web Deployment

This project is structured for seamless automated deployments. CassielDrive supports **Vercel Integration** out of the box. By pushing your code changes to the main branch, Vercel leverages the included `vercel.json` configuration to automatically trigger `flutter build web` and instantly deploy your latest UI updates worldwide.
