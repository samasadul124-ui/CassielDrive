# Introduction

A fast, lightweight terminal client for streaming and downloading movies, TV shows, anime, and live TV — powered by your local media player.

MovieBox-TUI replaces ad-heavy streaming websites and clunky browser players with a clean, keyboard-driven terminal interface. It scrapes stream links directly from multiple sources and launches playback in your native media player with hardware acceleration, audio track switching, and automatic subtitle synchronization.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Streaming**: Search and stream titles across MovieBox, 4KHDHub, BDIX mirrors, custom IPTV playlists, and community Stremio HTTP addons. Press `Ctrl+P` on the Details screen to switch providers in-place.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Playback**: Direct playback in `mpv`, `IINA` (macOS), or `VLC` with stream authentication headers forwarded automatically.
- **Automatic Subtitles**: Automatically searches, downloads, and syncs subtitles in your preferred language directly into your player.
- **Season Batch Downloads**: Download individual episodes or entire seasons with one keypress (`d`), with HTTP range resume support and clean folder structure (`Movies/` and `Series/`).
- **Interactive Settings Hub**: Configure your default media player, download folder, content modes, and themes inside an in-app visual modal via `/settings` (`Ctrl+S`).
- **Modes**: Switch instantly between standard Streaming, Live TV (`Ctrl+T`), and Addon Mode (`Ctrl+A`).
- **Ergonomics & Themes**: Full keyboard navigation (vim-style `j`/`k`, `/`, `Tab`) and mouse support (click, scroll, drag) with 6 built-in themes (Catppuccin, TokyoNight, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine) and terminal theme autodetection.

## Prerequisites

MovieBox-TUI delegates video decoding to an external media player. Install at least one of the following:

| Player | Platform | Quick Install |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **mpv** *(Recommended)* | Linux, macOS, Windows | `brew install mpv` / `sudo apt install mpv` / `winget install mpv` |
| **IINA** | macOS (Native GUI) | `brew install --cask iina` |
| **VLC** | Cross-platform | `brew install --cask vlc` / `sudo apt install vlc` / `winget install VideoLAN.VLC` |
| **Android Player** | Android (Termux) | `pkg install -y termux-tools termux-am` *(launches external player)* |
