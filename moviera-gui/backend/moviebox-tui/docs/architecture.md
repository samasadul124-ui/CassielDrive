# Architecture

MovieBox-Tui is a terminal client (ratatui + crossterm + tokio) for streaming movies,
series and TV channels from multiple providers. This document describes the shape of the
code and how data flows through it.

## The event loop

`App::run` (in `app/run.rs`) owns the only loop:

1. If `clear_terminal_before_draw` is set, the terminal buffer is cleared.
2. If `state.dirty`, the screen is drawn (`App::draw`).
3. `tokio::select!` waits for either:
   - an `Action` from the `EventHandler` (keyboard/mouse/focus/resize/tick), or
   - an `Action` pushed by a background task (network results, downloads, posters).

`EventHandler` (`event.rs`) spawns one task that reads crossterm events and a `Tick`
interval, forwarding them into the action channel (capacity 128).

## Async model

- The tokio runtime is multi-threaded (`rt-multi-thread`).
- **State is single-threaded**: all mutations to `AppState` happen inside
  `handle_action`, which is driven by the single event-loop task. Actions are
  serialized through the channel, so there are no data races on UI state.
- **Network** uses async `reqwest` clients (one per provider) plus per-provider signing.
- **Blocking work** (disk cache reads/writes, image decoding, M3U parsing, watch-history
  save, log cleanup) runs on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so the event loop is never
  blocked.
- Background tasks send `Action` messages back (e.g. `SearchSuccess`,
  `EpisodeStreamsReady`, `DownloadCompleted`), which `handle_action` consumes.

## Data flow — a typical search

1. User types a query; the `Key` handler updates `search_query` and sends `Action::Search`.
2. `handle_action` resolves the active provider, dispatches to the provider client
   (async), and spawns the request in a background task.
3. On success the task sends `Action::SearchSuccess`; `handle_action` stores
   `search_results`, marks `dirty`, and writes the provider search cache.
4. Posters for result rows are fetched by background tasks and delivered via
   `SearchPosterLoaded`/`PosterSuccess`; image protocols are cached per terminal.
5. `App::draw` renders the results; `dirty` is cleared.

## Playback flow

1. User selects a result → `Action::PlayStream` (moviebox) or 4KHDHub/BDIX resolve.
2. The provider resolves a `PlaybackSource` (url + optional headers/subtitle).
3. `launch_player` builds the player command (`player.rs`), optionally downloads the
   subtitle to a temp file, and spawns the player with null stdin/stdout and piped
   stderr; a blocking task waits and reports crashes.
4. Playback is handed to mpv / VLC / IINA / Android intent per the active player.

## Configuration and persistence

- `config.json` — settings (mode persistence, mode toggles, theme, provider, auto-update, `default_player`, download directory, BDIX) in the config dir.
- `addons_config.json` — installed HTTP community addons in the config dir.
- `tv_config.json` — user M3U playlist sources (URLs or file paths) in the config dir.
- `history.json` — watch history in the system data dir.
- `favorites.json`: starred titles in the system data dir, independent of `history.json`.
- `playback/` — temporary playback states for session crash/kill reconciliation in the system data dir.
- `scripts/` — bundled player scripts (`moviebox_tracker.lua`) in the system data dir.
- Cache lives under the system cache dir, keyed per provider.
- Logs live under the system data dir with rotation.

See `config.md` and `logging.md` for exact locations and formats.
